This project is a full stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). The goal of this project is to create a simple and intuitive web application that allows users to interact with a database.

The application will feature a user authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in and manage their accounts. The application will also have a dashboard page where users can view their data and interact with the database.

The application will use MongoDB for the backend database. Express.js will be used for routing and handling requests. React.js will be used for the frontend, allowing users to interact with the application. Finally, Node.js will be used to handle server-side logic.

We hope to create a useful, easy to use and attractive web application that can be used by anyone.
